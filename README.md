# Plagiarism_checker_ai
This project uses the MIT Plagiarism Detection Dataset to train a Semantic Language Model (SLM) that detects plagiarism in text documents. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab environment and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a working demo (no UI needed).
